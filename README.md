# Amazon-Fashion-Category-Web-Scraper
The project involves creating a web scraper to collect detailed information about products in the Amazon 'Fashion' category. The goal is to gather data on at least 1000 products from each subcategory (e.g., shoes, clothes, watches) and organize it in JSON format for trend analysis and insights into popular items.
